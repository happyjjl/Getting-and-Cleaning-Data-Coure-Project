* README.md             - The file while you are reading now  
* CodeBook.md           - Describes the experiment data and the steps taken to clean the data  
* final_tidy_data.txt   - Output file generated by the run_analysis.R script  
* run_analysis.R        - R script to merge, clean-up, transform, and summarize the experiment data  

## How to run the script

2. Extract the .zip file downloaded in Step 1 to your R working directory  
3. Make sure the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder extracted in Step 2 exist   
4. Run the script in R Console or Rstudio 
5. The script will create a final_tidy_data.txt in your R working directory
